### Introduction

The message below is issued if two or more variables in a C statement are volatile.
```
Warning[Pa082]: undefined behavior: the order of volatile accesses is undefined in this statement
```
The important  information in the message is the text ...order of volatile accesses is undefined... That is, the IAR C/C++ Compiler will (because it follows the ISO/ANSI standard) access the variables in an order that is not defined.

### Discussion

Volatile is (typically) used for variables that are accessed from several threads in the application and for the Special Function Registers that are the connection in/out of the chip. Study how the volatile variables in this C statement are used and decide if you must make a change or not.

One way to avoid the warning is to break up the C statement, so that each new C statement holds only one access to a volatile variable. In following example, the variables internalChannelSelect and ADC are volatile and will issue the Warning[Pa082].

This code example will give the [Pa082] warning:
```
intAnalogSample[internalChannelSelect] = ADC[internalChannelSelect];
```
The following change will make the C source predictable. Note that the temporary variables are NOT volatile:
```
int i;
int k;
i = internalChannelSelect;
k = ADC[i];
intAnalogSample[i] = k;
```
### Conclusion

To avoid the warning you can break up the C statement, so that each C statement holds only one access to a volatile variable.
